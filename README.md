## Usage
### Header
Made up of 4 separate sections: search, profile navigation, user greeting and a post section

### Side-bar
Made up of 3 sections: logo, navigation and settings

### Main
Made up of 3 sections: projects, announcements and trending. Projects portrays the user's projects in separate cards and has 3 interaction buttons tied to each card.

## Learining Objectives
My main objective for this project was learning how to work with grid. Grid was useful when laying out multiple columns and rows. However, I still used flex for certain single rows and columns. For example, each project card is a column flex container. I could have achieved the same result making each card into a grid container, but flex seems more intuitive for single-dimension lay-outs and utilized less setting up.
